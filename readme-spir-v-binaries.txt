To run the 2.1 conformance tests you need SPIR-V binaries.

If you are using a conformance package then the binaries are included in the
package. If you are using conformance tests from gitlab repositories then the
binaries need to be picked up from Khronos SVN URL mentioned below:

https://cvs.khronos.org/svn/repos/OpenCL/trunk/Khronos/spirv/spirv10_2015.11.25.zip
